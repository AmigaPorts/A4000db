Second version of my A4000 Daughterboard.

This new release fixes a few things:

* Adjusted Zorro slots Â½ mm to the left. 
* Video connector, less wide at bottom. 
* Changed Molex connector a floppy type.
* Change entire board to make it 4 Layer instead of 2 layers.
* Bottom connectors are now rounded so They Can fit nicely on the onboard connectors.
* Added a breakout part than can be removed in case more space for cables needed.
* Add an external clock footprint to in case main clock must be different from the onboard clock. This can be enable or disables by setting a jumper.
