# A4000DB

This is a recreation of the Amiga 4000 Daughter Board made from ground using the A4000 original schematics. It includes all the Zorro slots and also include a VGA 15khz output connector to use with a VGA metal bracket. The ISA ports has been removed from the design.

This work great on all the Amiga 4000 versions, except of course the A4000T.

# Note

This is a work in progress, several testing must be made but it should work as is. I take no responsibiltiy for any damage to any equipment that results from the use of this board. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

I will try to add more features to this DB when I can. The idea is to have a good DB replacement or a better one if you don't have any.

Gerbers are on the gerbers folder. Remember to say to your favorite pcb service that is a good recommendation to make bevel cut on the edge connectors (knows as 45º chamfered border).

Important! If you like this project, buy me a beer or a Mercedes Benz SLR whatever you want :) - info@arananet.net

Update 27/12/2018: Some users have found a little of difficulty to plug large boards like CV3D or Fastlane using the Daughterboard. Until the next release, the easy fix is to remove the plastic guides from the front of the a4000 (those brown ones) on the slots that is gonna be used for the large boards. The zorro slots are displaced like ½mm to the right and must go to the left.

Note: For the videoslot you need to dremel a 100 pin connector in half in order to put it on place.
